.SH NAME
rbootstrap \- Install RPM based Linux into Chroot Jails
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rbootstrap
.RB [ OPTION\&.\&.\&. ]
.I CODENAME TARGET

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rbootstrap
is a tool for setting up the RPM based Linux distributions choosen by
.I CODENAME
in a chroot jails below the
.I TARGET
. The goal of the project is to have a tool like debootstrap for Debian and
Ubuntu for RPM based distributions like CentOS, RedHat, OpenSuSE, SLES and so on.

You can get a list of supported Linux distributions by executing \fBrbootstrap --list-codenames\fR.

rbootstrap has been created to get a lightweight option for setting up virtual
environments of Linux distributions. These environments, so called jails or
chroots, can for example be used for setting up a build or packaging environment
for these distributions.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
.IP  "\fICODENAME\fP"
The codename specifies the Linux distribution and version to install. This must
be a supported one. Use the command \fBrbootstrap \-\-list-codenames\fR to get
the list of distros.
.IP
.IP  "\fITARGET\fP"
Specifies the path to the target directory to create the chroot jail in.
This path might already be existant.
.IP

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.IP "\fB\-\-arch=ARCH\fP"
Set the architecture to install (default: x86_64)
The possible options depend on the architecures supported
by the distribution to be installed into the jail. Most
support "x86_64" and "i386".
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-include=A,B,C\fP"
The packages specified here will be installed using the
package manager after the initial installation has been
finished.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude=A,B,C\fP"
Remove these package names from the list of packages to
be installed.
.IP

.PP
.IP "\fB\-\-no-check-pkg-sig\fP"
Do not verify that packages are signed with the GPG key
retrieved from the repository. By default all packages
are checked when installing them to the JAIL.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-pre-erase\fP"
Completely clear all data in \fITARGET\fR before setting it up.
When the jail is still used by mounted filesystems or
running processes rbootstrap will terminate with an
error message.
If you like to perform a forced erasement, use the flag
\fB\-\-force-erase\fR together with this option.

\fIBE CAREFUL:\fR When you point \fITARGET\fR to another directory
than the jail, the data below this directory will be
removed anyways.
.IP "\fB\-\-keep-pkgs\fP"
Use this to make \fB--pre-erase\fR keep the downloaded
packages. This is useful when you do not want to
download already loaded packages again.
.IP "\fB\-\-force-load-pkgs\fP"
By default the locally existing packages are used
when their checksums match the repositories metadata.
This prevents duplicate downloading and might save time.
You can use this flag to ignore all existing packages
to download them again.

.PP
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\fP"
Use this mirror instead of the default mirror specified
for the choosen distribution.
.IP "\fB\-\-gpgkey\fP"
Use this GPG key instead of the default one specified
for the choosen distribution.

.PP
.IP "\fB\-\-list-codenames\fP"
Prints out a list of supported Linux distributions
.IP "\fB\-\-print-pkgs\fP"
Print the packages to be installed, then exit
.
.IP "\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP"
Print out version information
.IP "\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP"
Print the help screen

.SH EXAMPLES
.
.PP
To setup a \fICentOS 7.0\fR system below the path \fB/var/lib/centos_7.0_jail\fR
use:
.PP
    rbootstrap centos_7.0 /var/lib/centos_7.0_jail
