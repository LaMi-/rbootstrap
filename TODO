A collection of short notes on what to do one day.

* Care about output (Logging / Output / Verbose logging)
* Add output or example to manpage which commands to
  use to use the chroot jail properly (mount, chroot, ...)
* Check GPG keys
* Handle multiple repositories
* Add support for distros
  * SLES
  * RedHat
  * CentOS
  * Fedora
* Add mode where dependency tree of packages is visualized
  (Would be helpful for adding new distros)
* Add some tests
* Add man page
