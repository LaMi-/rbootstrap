A collection of short notes on what to do one day.

* Handle multiple repositories
* Add support for distros
  * RedHat
* Add some tests
* Add bash completion for distros
* Add output or example to manpage which commands to
  use to use the chroot jail properly (mount, chroot, ...)
* Add man page for rbchroot
* Set prompt during init
* add option to replace files like uname, ldconfig
* Add tests which check the final distro for specific commands
  which we define as essential, e.g. "hostname", "tar"
